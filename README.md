# NatLangKG
AI-Enhanced Semantic Interfacing for Decentralized Knowledge Graphs

Description:
Our project aims to harness the capabilities of advanced language models to create a natural language interface for the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). We plan to empower non-technical users to query Knowledge Assets with ease, transforming natural language input into SPARQL and providing understandable natural language outputs. Our initiative promotes a broader adoption of the DKG by making it more user-friendly, while also contributing to the democratization and trustworthiness of AI by rooting the model in a verifiable data source.

To facilitate integration with other projects and maximize synergy, our project will utilize existing transformer-based text embeddings and, as a novel approach, leverage graph embeddings for a better understanding of the DKG structure. Our open-source ethos allows us to provide compensation to contributors for valuable contributions such as training data and model improvements.

Milestones, Timeline, and Expected Impact:

Phase 1 (Month 1): Dataset Collection and Creation
The first phase involves creating a dataset of SPARQL queries matched with their natural language counterparts. We'll encourage community contributions, verified through a validation process and rewarded through smart contracts. During this phase, we will also explore and identify parts of the DKG to be used for creating graph embeddings.

Phase 2 (Months 2-4): Development of Graph Embeddings and LLM Training
Building on the insights gained from the initial dataset collection, we'll develop graph embeddings to complement the existing text embeddings, which will provide a richer understanding of the DKG and improve the precision of the natural language to SPARQL conversion. Concurrently, we will fine-tune an open-source Large Language Model using the dataset from Phase 1.

Phase 3 (Month 5): Integration
We will blend our freshly trained LLM with the graph embeddings to construct a comprehensive tool that captures the best of both worlds. The goal is to leverage the strength of the language model in understanding natural language and the power of the graph embeddings in understanding the structure and context of the DKG.

Phase 4 (Month 6): Launch, Beta Testing, and Refinement
With the tool now ready, we will wrap it in a user-friendly interface and conduct a comprehensive beta testing phase, rewarding testers for their time and invaluable feedback. Insights from the testing phase will be instrumental in refining the AI model and interface, ensuring it is optimized for end-users.

Expected Impact:
By transforming how users interact with the OriginTrail DKG, we expect to boost its utility and accessibility, promoting its widespread use. By enriching knowledge assets with structural metadata, our solution will provide a more nuanced understanding of the DKG, making the data querying process more intuitive, and lowering barriers for non-technical users.

Budget:
We request a budget of $20K-$30K to fairly compensate contributors, beta testers, and our development team. This budget will also cover the costs of cloud computing resources for model training and software development costs. Our goal is to utilize these funds in a way that aligns with the decentralized and community-driven spirit of the OriginTrail DKG.

As the lead developer, I am open to the idea of working collaboratively with other developers and sharing the workload. This collaboration would further foster the spirit of community and decentralization that underpins this project.
